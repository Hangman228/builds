## Development

This site is build with Nuxt.JS, a Vue.JS framework. To run and work on this
project, you will need to have `node` and `npm` installed. The official node
website has [great
instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) on how to do
this.

Once you have `node` and `npm` installed, you can run these commands to start
the dev server.

```sh
npm ci # Installs the packages
npm start # Starts the web server
```

You will see a url in your terminal that you can click to see the website.
